				One of my hobbies is cubing. The term "Cubing" refers to solving different puzzles and not just the famous Rubik's Cube.
				There are many types of puzzles such as the cubes ranging from the 2x2 to the 17x17.
				More of the popular puzzles are the square-1, pyraminx, and the megaminx.
				In fact, cubing is getting really popular these days.
				The quality of the products are getting better each year, letting more people join in the hobby.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is so easy to start learning how to solve puzzles now because there are so many resources online.
				In this website, it helps cubers, beginners and veterans, to learn more algorithms, including myself.
				This site was inspired by other cubing websites such as Dan's Cubing Cheat Sheet, Ruwix, and CubeSkills
				which has more methods and algorithms for you to discover.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that all of the images here&mdash;logo, algorithms, and favicon&mdash;were made by me. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I'll continue to update this site every once in a while. I want to add more algorithms like listing the full OLL.
				There are other puzzles that I want to include like the bigger cubes, the 2x2, and the megaminx
				since those are the puzzles I am more familiar with.
